This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

# Welcome to my "Flashcards" react-native web app!

### This app was tested on Android devices only, but should work fine on iOS too.
Below you'll find information about how to run the project.
## Project Overview
This project consists in building a small application that allows users to study collections of
flashcards. The users can create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards
to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## Why this project?
This project is meant to help the student gaining an understanding of how to use React Native to
build an iOS and Android application.

## How to install and run the application

To run the app follow these simple steps:

- install the Expo App on your smartphone. You can find it here:
   - [Expo on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) (Android)
   - [Expo on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779) (iOS)

- clone this repo and:
  - navigate to the repo folder and run `npm install`
  - once node modules have been installed, run `npm start`
  - once the package starts, instructions will be logged in your terminal, explaining how to view
  the app on your phone. So, open the Expo app you previously installed, follow those instructions
  and have fun!
